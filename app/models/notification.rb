  #          That is so it can store, in binary form, the applicant and email info

  #  NOTE:
  #       In /notifications/index.html.erb, we use Rails collection rendering to render all
  #       @notifications, which, recall, can be of a number of subclasses.
  #       For collection rendering to work with the multiple class names that come with using
  #       single table inheritance we need to update the Notification model to override the
  #       Rails default 'to_partial_path'.
  #         Context:  Models that inherit from ActiveRecord::Base
  #                   will return, to render, a partial name based on the modelâ€™s name by default.
  #
  #   Without this change, collection rendering for notifications would attempt to look up the
  #   partial based on each notification's class and we would get an error telling us that no
  #   partial named "inbound_email_notifications/inbound_email_notification" exists.
