<!-- The helper turbo_frame_tag injects <turbo_frame id= into the DOM.
      In this case that would be <turbo_frame id="jobs">
      Thus we are setting up this partial to be the "response" portion of a Turbo_frame interaction.
      Turbo will expect a corresponding "request" (contained in a different partial) to
      contain the same <turbo_frame id="jobs"

      In this case the "request" comes from the filter_form partial and this response then
      renders the jobs portion of the index page according to the filter criteria

       -->
<%= turbo_frame_tag "jobs", class: "divide-y divide-gray-200" do %>
  <%= render jobs %>
<% end %>
